/**
 * This game class encapsulates the game tactics for a simple autonomous controlling of a robot
 * swarm. It has the following structure:
 * - the "round started" event triggers the main round() method
 * - if there is enough money, new robots are bought (or, depending on configuration, existing robots are upgraded)
 * - for each robot, the proper command is chosen and issued (based on the configured tactics)
 * - each time an answer is received (with transaction id), the robots and the map are updated.
